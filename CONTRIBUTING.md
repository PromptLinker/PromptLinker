# Contributing to PromptLinker

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `PromptLinker`! We're excited to build a community around the "Agents-as-Code" paradigm and create a foundational tool for professional AI development.

## An Early-Stage Project

`PromptLinker` is currently in the early design and architectural phase. The core infrastructure is actively being built.

While we are not accepting major pull requests for new features at this moment, we welcome discussions, ideas, and feedback.

## How to Get Involved Right Now

The best way to contribute at this early stage is by getting involved in the conversation:

*   **Open an Issue:** If you have a feature idea, a question about the architectural vision, or a suggestion, please [open an issue](https://github.com/PromptLinker/PromptLinker/issues). This is the most valuable form of contribution as we lay the groundwork.
*   **Discuss the Vision:** We want to build a tool that the community loves. Your feedback on our core philosophy and roadmap is invaluable.

Once the foundational code is more mature, this guide will be updated with detailed instructions for setting up a development environment and submitting pull requests.

## Code of Conduct

All participants in this project are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive community.

We look forward to building with you.
